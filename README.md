# About
At FoodSystem, our ultimate goal is to ensure that no one goes hungry in our neighborhoods. Through our website, we strive to create a supportive and inclusive environment where individuals can easily access the nourishment they need to thrive. 

The website uses public API's and our own custom API, paired with mongoDB's geospacial functionality to recommend food banks/community kitchens to users based on location. 

## How we built it
FoodSystem was built using the MERN stack, google's Maps API, and the browsers geolocation API. We designed the application in Figma before bringing it to life through our development process. It is fully responsive on both mobile, tablet, and web so anyone can use this website at any time - whether they are researching options at home or on the bus.
